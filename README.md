Yelp Dataset Challenge

This work is a piece of data analytics and data mining of Yelp dataset (https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge). The dataset is converted from JSON to CSV in Python (refer to yelp_conv.py), and then explored in R (refer to yelp.R) through feature engineering, visualization, text mining and network mining of businesses, reviews, users, and checkins. We figured out some useful latent findings, e.g., users weigh more on dessert, pancake, cheese, wine and beer when they review higher-rated restaurants, but less on salad and sandwich.
